# B58_Assembly_Arcade_Game

- Game made for CSCB58: Computer Organizations. I built a platform game using MIPS Assembly.
- Character can jump onto four platforms, where two platforms move left to right.
- Fireballs drop from sky randomly from three specified locations.
- Sometimes, power items drop.
  - Green: Extra health. You can have a max. of 5 health.
  - Pink: Gives you extra time to prepare for the next fireball.
  - Purple: Makes all the fireballs disappear onscreen.
- If you fall to the bottom or reach the ceiling, you instantly die.
- You lose 1 health for one pixel touching the inside of the fireball.
- Last but not least, ENJOY!!!
